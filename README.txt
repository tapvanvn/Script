Scripts is placed in appropriate folders. Such as:
- PowerShell folder for powershell scripts
- UbuntuShell folder for scripts that using bash shell and run only on Ubuntu.
- Python3 folder for python3 script.

Each script folder should have a Modules folder to hold scripts which run as a module or a library for other scripts.
